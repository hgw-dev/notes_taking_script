--------Register allocation--------

replace variable accesses by register access
	fixed set of registers
	2 simultaneously live (SL) variables cannot be allocated to the same register

1. Identify live variable ranges
	Use "register interference graph"
		shows what variables are SL

Register interference graph
	node for every temporary
	edge between t1 and t2 if they are SL
	2 temps can be allocated to the same register if there is no edge connecting them

	nodes can be assigned a color corresponding to the register assigned to the variable
	a color cannot be linked to the same color in the graph

Graph coloring
	a 'coloring' of a graph is an assignment of colors to nodes, such that nodes connected by an edge having different colors
	a graph is k-colorable if 

	Kempe's algorithm for finding a K-coloring of a graph
		1) find a node with at most K-1 edges and remove from the graph (with its edges)
			Remember this node on a stack for later stages
		2) when the simplified subgraph has been colored, add back the node on the top of the stack and assign it a color not taken by one of the adjacent nodes
		3) spilling- once all nodes have K or more neighbors, pick a node for spilling
			store on the stack

		Failure
			everything left has at least K neighbors
				sometimes still K-colorable (NP-complete problem)


-------------Local Optimizations-------------
Optimizations
	Local
	Global
	Interprocedural

Finding "optimal optimization" is NP complete problem

Loop transformations
	- loop interchange
	- loop unrolling
	- loop fusion

Statement level optimizations
	- constant propagation and folding
	- loop invariant code motion
	- partial redundancy elimination
	- partial dead code elimination
	- register allocation
