we use the Von Neumann model/ architecture
	- also called 'stored program computer' 
	- stored program
		- instructions stored in a linear memory array
		- memory is unified between instructions and data
		- interpretation of stored value depends on control signals
	- sequential instruction processing
		- one instruction processed (fetched, executed, completed) at a time
		- program counter (instruction pointer) identifies current instr.
		- program counter is advanced sequentially except for control transfer instructions
